The architectural decoration engineering of clean room mainly refers to the sealing operation of cracks in the joints of ground and floor decoration engineering, plastering engineering, door and window engineering, ceiling engineering, partition engineering, paint engineering, grouting engineering, cracks and various pipelines, lighting fixtures, purifying air conditioning equipment and process equipment with buildings, besides the main structure and external doors and windows.

The importance of building decoration in clean rooms is mainly manifested in the following two aspects:
(1) The impact on comprehensive performance: clean room requires no dust production, dust-free structure, tightly sealed and dustproof. So the decoration of the clean room will directly clean the effect.
(2) Influences on cost: Compared with general office buildings, clean rooms are high-cost buildings.

Requirements for decorative materials
1. General requirements
Smooth surface; The surface has wear resistance; Good thermal insulation; It is not easy to generate static electricity. No moisture absorption, no moisture permeability; Good sound absorption; Easy to process; The surface is not easy to adhere to dust; It is easy to remove the attached dust. The price is cheap. 
2. Decoration of the ground
(1) General requirements
Abrasion resistance; corrosion resistance (acid, alkali, medicine); Antistatic; Fourth, skid resistance; Seamless processing; Easy to clean. (2)Species
Double floor The general characteristics are: the ground of a typical vertical one-way flow clean room. The general features are: ground air return, good air permeability, high cost, poor elasticity.
Terrazzo floor The general features are: smooth, not easy to dust, good integrity, washable, anti-static, no elasticity.
Paint floor The general features are: with the advantages of terrazzo, wear resistance, good sealing, elasticity, complex construction.
Material: It is made of epoxy resin, polyester resin and polyurethane resin by adding pigments and hardening agent. The cement label of cement mortar base is no less than 425 #.
Coiled sheet floor The general features are: smooth, wear-resistant, slightly elastic, not easy to dust, easy to clean, simple construction, easy to generate static electricity, easy to aging by ultraviolet radiation, because different from concrete expansion system, easy to shell in large areas.
Acid-resistant magnetic plate ground The general features are: corrosion resistance, but brittle quality can not withstand impact, complex construction, high cost, suitable for areas with corrosion resistance requirements, and appropriate to use water retaining line enclosure.
FRP Floor
The general features are: corrosion resistance, good integrity, but the expansion coefficient is different from the base, so it is suitable for small area use, and use fire-resistant varieties.

3. wall surface
(1) General requirements
Not dirty, easy to clean; Smooth surface; No dust is produced once the surface is peeled off or damaged. Impact resistance; The corner can be treated with arc material or sealing material. (2) Species
Advanced plastering
